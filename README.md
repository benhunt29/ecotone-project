## Ecotone Calculator Application

#About:
[Ecotone Partners] (http://ecotone-partners.com/) help their clients measure, manage, and communicate their social, environmental, and business (economical) impacts.
They work with “hybrid” companies like non-profits that have business activities, traditional corporations that have philanthropy, and B-corps which are for-profit corporations that includes positive impact on society and the environment.

#Project:
Ecotone would like a calculator to discover cost savings and environmental impact of upcycling (Reuse vs. Recycling).
The application will be free and will allow unregistered users to use the calculator. If a user instead chooses to create an account, they will have the ability to create projects and save calculations to projects.

#Details:
The EPA offers a calculator, [WARM](http://www3.epa.gov/warm/Warm_Form.html), that calculates the carbon offset for various waste management practices. The calculator is not user-friendly and doesn't contain common items. Ecotone has a proxy list, a way to map common items to uncommon categories. The proxy list is integrated into this application. 

#Features and technology
The application uses PostgreSQL, Express, AngularJS, and node.js. Features include: user accounts, account modification, password reset, project creation, project csv upload, administrator features, and new material suggestions.
